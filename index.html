          Sequoyah was a Native American polymath of the Cherokee Nation. In
          1821 he completed his independent creation of the Cherokee syllabary,
          making reading and writing in Cherokee possible. This lithograph is
          from the portrait painted by Charles Bird King in 1828.

          Georgia, December 1829. The Cherokee Nation, protesting the state of
          Georgiaâ€™s attempt to extend its authority over their lands, wrote this
          memorial in 1829. Written in both English and Cherokee, it is a
          plaintive appeal to remain on their ancestral lands. More info at
